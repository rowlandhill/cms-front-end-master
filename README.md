# About "DMR^2 CMS"

Our team, over the course of three days, built a Content Management System (CMS) that allows visitors to: - See content on the app without being signed in.
When logged in:
    - Users are able to create their own ‘pages’ with a title and description, and create ‘posts’ on those pages that have a title and content.
    - Users are able to manage the content once it's created: Display it, Edit it, Delete it.

-  Deployed Application - https://team-ramrod-wdi.github.io/front-end/
-  Back End Repository - https://github.com/rowlandhill/cms-back-end-master


## Technologies Used

-   Front End - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, handlebars, and bootstrap.
-   Back End - Node.js, Express, mongoDB, and mongoose.
-   Git/GitHub

## Approach

To start, we created a team GitHub account to host our Front End and Back End repositories. Everyone on the team cloned the repos locally in order to add contributions to the project.

We all created user stories, wireframes, and ERD models and collaboratively compared. We then decided which ones to use and made realistic goals for our project.

As a team, we decided that David would be the project lead. Over the course of development, David, Rowland, Ross and Micaela would evenly divide the labor for the Front End and Back end. We decided that pair programming and group coding was the most efficient way to get the job done. As far as using Git/GitHub, we were never working on the same files at the same time. This avoided merge conflicts.

Clear communication and decision making were a key asset for teamwork.

## Unsolved Problems and Challenges

We would like to create a stronger user interface and cleaner design. We also would have liked to build a feature that allowed image uploads on the app.

One notable challenge that we faced was creating a relationship between pages and posts, where posts belong to a specific page.
Another challenge was displaying content for visitors, without giving them the ability to create, update or delete.
With any and all challenges that our team faced, coming together with clear communication and teamwork, we were able to come to a solution together.
